Technical Requirements
The hair salon website is developed using the following technologies:

Frontend:  Angular #14
Backend:  Java, Spring framework and PostgreSQL #15 #13
Database: [Insert Database System]
The specific backend framework/language and database system will depend on the developer's preference and requirements.

Out of Scope
The following functionalities are currently out of scope for the hair salon website:

Admin Panel: An admin panel for managing the website's configurations, settings, and content is not included in the current scope. This functionality allows administrators to oversee the platform, handle business-related issues, and maintain the quality of the website.

Responsive UI Design: The website's UI design is not responsive, meaning it may not adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions. As a result, the user experience on smaller screens may not be optimal.

Filtering Jobs: The website does not include a filtering option for job applications from specific users. For example, the salon cannot limit job applications to only users with specific skills or qualifications.

Integrated Chat: Communication between the salon and users after a candidate is selected is not facilitated within the website. Instead, users' email addresses will be visible, allowing communication via email. As a result, an integrated chat feature within the website is not available.

Please note that these features may be considered for future development or customization based on specific requirements and priorities.
